# 3DViewer
 Interactive 3D viewer for academic content using the Unity framework and the Unity programming API (in the C # language).
 
 Design patterns, methods of instantiation and classes were studied to carry out a flexible and decoupled architecture providing modularity and extensibility to the application. An event system based on the observer pattern was used, which allowed the development of different functionalities. Among them it was achieved:

* Manipulation of groups of geometries allowing them to be selected, moved, rotated and hidden.

* Handling camera movement.

* A label system that provides informative descriptions of the various geometries.

* The cutting of geometries through different predefined planes.

* The play and pause of animations in 3D models.

* A disarm function which allows rapid disassembly of complex pieces.

* A reset function to the original positions of the geometries.
